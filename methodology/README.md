## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Using Node.js Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd diagramming-interface

# Start the server
node server.js

# Open browser and go to:
# http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

### Option 2: Using Python Server
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd diagramming-interface

# Start the server
python server.py

# Open browser and go to:
# http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

### Option 3: Direct File Access
Open `index.html` directly in your browser (methodology viewer may have CORS limitations).

## üéÆ How to Use

### Creating Diagrams
1. **Add Shapes**: Drag shapes from the left toolbox to the canvas or click on shapes
2. **Select Elements**: Click on any shape to select it
3. **Edit Properties**: Use the right panel to modify colors, text, size, and position
4. **Create Connections**: Click on red connection points and drag to another shape
5. **Move Elements**: Drag selected shapes around the canvas
6. **Delete Elements**: Select and press Delete key or use the Delete button

### Using the Methodology System
1. **Select Methodology**: Use the dropdown in the top toolbar
2. **View Details**: Click the "View" button to open the methodology modal
3. **Learn Approaches**: Read about different development methodologies
4. **Compare Methods**: Switch between methodologies to see different approaches

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Delete` - Delete selected element
- `Escape` - Deselect all elements
